# Cloudflare Workers configuration for Gothic Forge Demo
# This Worker handles dynamic endpoints (/counter/sync) alongside Cloudflare Pages (static assets)
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Deploy your Pages site first: gforge deploy pages --project=your-project --run
# 2. Note your Pages URL (e.g., https://your-project.pages.dev)
# 3. Update the routes below with your actual Pages domain
# 4. Deploy this Worker: gforge deploy workers --run
# 5. The Worker will handle /counter/sync on your Pages domain

name = "gothic-forge-demo-worker"
main = "counter.js"
compatibility_date = "2025-01-01"

# IMPORTANT: Update these routes with your actual Pages domain
# Example: If your Pages URL is https://gothic-forge-demo.pages.dev
# Then update to: { pattern = "gothic-forge-demo.pages.dev/counter/*", zone_name = "" }
#
# Note: You can also set this up in Cloudflare Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Workers & Pages > Your Worker
# 2. Click "Triggers" tab
# 3. Add a route for your Pages domain

# For now, deploy without routes and configure in Dashboard
# routes = [
#   { pattern = "your-project.pages.dev/counter/*" }
# ]
